// Let's get some practice working with DOM element attributes. I've provided you with some very basic markup.  Please select the image element and:

// change its source to this url: https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg

// change its alt text to be "chicken"

const eggImg = document.querySelector('img');
eggImg.setAttribute('src', 'https://devsprouthosting.com/images/chicken.jpg');
eggImg.setAttribute('alt', 'chicken');
