<!-- In this exercise, I'm asking you to write some inline event handlers WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING I RECOMMEND, but hopefully it will illustrate to you just how annoying it can be. In index.html, you'll find an <h1> element and a <button>.  Please add two inline click handlers directly in the html:

    When the h1 is clicked, you should print*  "boo"
    
    When the button is clicked, you should print "clicked"
    
    * "print" = console.log('something here'); -->
